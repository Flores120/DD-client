            <p>However, even though I knew I was ready for a change, I needed
            one more thing to really push me over the edge and get me to
            move from feeling sluggish and defeated, to energized and alive.</p>

            <p>Anyway, I can't believe I did this, but I got into my car and decided
            to drive home after my 12 hour shift - even though I was sleep

            <p>Naturally, she thought I was making the whole thing up, and it wouldn't have made a difference if I did anyway because the bottom line was that this was her breaking point.</p>
            <p>She was beyond upset, and told me she was packing up her stuff and leaving "for a few days."</p>

            <p>That’s right. All their misinformation is enough to confuse the smartest person alive, and it confused me for years...</p>

              <p>Well, a recent Ohio State University study compared the glycemic index of typical energy bars with other sources of carbs. And these “power bars” were found to be no better than a candy bar at providing sustained energy!</p>

              <p>You absolutely must know about the “Fad Diet Pitfall” you HAVE TO AVOID if you want to increase your energy levels and well-being... and this one may surprise you:</p>
              <p>You see, most people believe that following Fad Diets is actually a good way to look and feel better, at least in the short term... however, this simply isn't true:</p>
            </div>

          <div class="style2-box" style="background: white; color:black;">
            <img id="dougnut" src="img/dougnut.png" alt="">
            <p>If you don't avoid these kinds of diets, you will experience energy slumps, sugar cravings, exhaustion, and eventually - weight gain...</p>
            <p>Think of it like this: look back to the last time you experienced any stress or fatigue. Did you crave salty, sugary, or carb-filled foods... maybe even junk food or fast food?</p>
            <p>This is a sign that the type of foods you’re eating while on a fad diet are actually causing your entire metabolic cycle to malfunction.</p>
            <p>It eventually makes your body BEG for foods high in sugar, salt, and carbs... not to mention, it rapidly drains your energy.</p>
            <p>With that said, here's the secret: STOP following any kind of fad diet, no matter how cutting-edge, popular, or tempting they may be.</p>
            <p>And you don't have to avoid them forever - just until you've reached your ideal goal of increased vitality, so don't worry.</p>
            <p>Here's what you do instead: just narrow your focus onto things like vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids, and make sure you balance them at all at the right ratio... if you do this right, you may never need to starve yourself or eliminate entire food groups from your diet ever again.</p>

              <p>For example: there’s those “health bars” and “nutrition snacks” that you see being sold everywhere on the internet, and in the markets all across the world...</p>
              <p>We’re told they’re healthy and contain an “ideal ratio” of nutrients, and they’re good for us, right? And that they’ll boost our energy, and provide good nutrition in addition to our regular diet?</p>
              <p>Well, a recent Ohio State University study compared the glycemic index of typical energy bars with other sources of carbs. And these “power bars” were found to be no better than a candy bar at providing sustained energy!</p>
              <p>So, the fact of the matter is you should never solely rely on this "expert advice" you see in articles, magazines, YouTube videos, and on social media.</p>

            <p>Here's how it works: first, you need to recognize that there are natural forces beyond your control. These forces are responsible for the highs and lows - the ebbs and flows - of your energy levels... think of them as "natural rhythms."<p>
            <p>Then, all you have to do is sync your day with these natural rhythms, and make sure that you time it just right, so that you are at peak energy levels when you need to get things done the most.<p>
            <p>With practice, you'll sync your body and get all the timing down, and you can <b>literally CONTROL your own body’s rhythms and energy cycles.</b><p>
