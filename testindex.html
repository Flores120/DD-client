        <p>And you know what? Here's what's funny to me: I now get comments like, 'you were probably always up-beat, energetic, and full of smiles' - while in fact, I used to be the exact opposite!</p>
        <p>Thinking back, that was all only a little over a decade ago - in January, 2002...</p>
        <p>I had Just gotten into another huge argument with my wife, and I felt as cold inside as the weather felt outside.</p>

            <p>However, even though I knew I was ready for a change, I needed
            one more thing to really push me over the edge and get me to

            <p>Anyway, I can't believe I did this, but I got into my car and decided

            <p>If you don't avoid these kinds of diets, you will experience energy slumps, sugar cravings, exhaustion, and eventually - weight gain...</p>
            <p>Think of it like this: look back to the last time you experienced any stress or fatigue. Did you crave salty, sugary, or carb-filled foods... maybe even junk food or fast food?</p>
            <p>This is a sign that the type of foods you’re eating while on a fad diet are actually <b>causing your entire metabolic cycle to malfunction.</b></p>
            <p>It eventually makes your body <b>BEG</b> for foods high in sugar, salt, and carbs... not to mention, it rapidly drains your energy.</p>
            <p>With that said, here's the secret: <b>STOP following any kind of fad diet</b>, no matter how cutting-edge, popular, or tempting they may be.</p>
            <p>And you don't have to avoid them forever - just until you've reached your ideal goal of increased vitality, so <b>don't worry</b>.</p>
            <p><b>Here's what you do instead</b>: just narrow your focus onto things like vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids, and make sure you balance them at all at the right ratio... if you do this right, you may never need to starve yourself or eliminate entire food groups from your diet ever again.</p>

            <p>Here's how it works: first, you need to recognize that there are natural forces beyond your control. These forces are responsible for the highs and lows - the ebbs and flows - of your energy levels... think of them as "natural rhythms."<p>
            <p>Then, all you have to do is sync your day with these natural rhythms, and make sure that you time it just right, so that you are at peak energy levels when you need to get things done the most.<p>

          <br>
          <p>However, you’ll probably end up spending 10, 20, even 100 times more than the investment you'll make today in Infinite Vitality System in trying out more fad diets, taking more time off work, and on doctors’ visits and other medical costs...</p>

            <p>Still here? It's OK, I can imagine this presentation was quite different from other ones you've seen before.</p>
            <p>With that said, let me take a minute or so and go ahead and answer some of the most common questions I get asked:</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="common-question question-1">
          <div class="common-question-answer">
            <div class="common-question-question">
              <p>I've seen other programs like this before... and they didn't work so well for me. Why will this be any different?</p>
            </div>
            <p>The reason is simple. You cannot reverse fatigue and burnout by focusing solely on sleeping more, or sleeping less, or by just following some fad diet, or relying on excessive exercise alone.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This program takes a multi-pronged approach, and attacks all the sources of your low energy from the core.</p>
            <br>
            <p>By following this program, you can "reprogram" different parts of your body and mind, where all those other programs only focus on one simple area... and, those other programs only offer short term results.</p>
            <p>So for the first time in youur entire life, it's not only POSSIBLE to feel newfound levels of energy and vitality...</p>
            <br>
            <p>It's also possible to increase your mood, boost your sex drive, feel a daily surge of motivation, and so much more.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="common-question question-2">
          <div class="common-question-answer">
            <div class="common-question-question">
              <p>Do you have a guarantee or a refund policy if I decide it’s not right for me?</p>
            </div>
            <p>The first step would be to make sure you’re following all the steps as outlined inside the digital book, and the accompanying bonus video series.</p>
            <br>
            <p>But remember, there is literally zero risk with the Infinite Vitality System.</p>
            <br>
            <p>You have a full 60-day, 100% money back guarantee. Meaning that, if at any point during the 60 days, you decide it’s not for you, you can ask for a full refund. No hassles, no hard feelings. You don’t even have to return the product.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Your satisfaction is 100% guaranteed!</p>

              <p>What about all that diet and exercise advice I’ve already learned and tried?</p>
            </div>
            <p>Well, right now, all that “learning” is part of what’s holding you back… until you first unlearn all the “fad advice” you’ve heard about creating lifelong energy and vitality. Then… the sky’s the limit!</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="common-question question-4">
          <div class="common-question-answer">
            <div class="common-question-question">
              <p>How soon can I expect results?</p>
            </div>
            <p>Well, everyone is different, and not everybody responds the same way to the Infinite Vitality System. </p>
            <br>
            <p>However, some people do experience powerful results the very next morning.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Others take some time. So we ask that you just follow the blueprint as directed, every day for at least 7 days, before you fully evaluate your results.</p>
