          <p>Still here? It's OK, I can imagine this presentation was quite different from other ones you've seen before.</p>
          <p>With that said, let me take a minute or so and go ahead and answer some of the most common questions I get asked:</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="common-question question-1">
        <div class="common-question-answer">
          <div class="common-question-question">
            <p>I've seen other programs like this before... and they didn't work so well for me. Why will this be any different?</p>
          </div>
          <p>The reason is simple. You cannot reverse fatigue and burnout by focusing solely on sleeping more, or sleeping less, or by just following some fad diet, or relying on excessive exercise alone.</p>
          <br>
          <p>This program takes a multi-pronged approach, and attacks all the sources of your low energy from the core.</p>
          <br>
          <p>By following this program, you can "reprogram" different parts of your body and mind, where all those other programs only focus on one simple area... and, those other programs only offer short term results.</p>
          <p>So for the first time in youur entire life, it's not only POSSIBLE to feel newfound levels of energy and vitality...</p>
          <br>
          <p>It's also possible to increase your mood, boost your sex drive, feel a daily surge of motivation, and so much more.</p>

      <div class="common-question question-2">
        <div class="common-question-answer">
          <div class="common-question-question">
            <p>Do you have a guarantee or a refund policy if I decide it’s not right for me?</p>
          </div>
          <p>The first step would be to make sure you’re following all the steps as outlined inside the digital book, and the accompanying bonus video series.</p>
          <br>
          <p>But remember, there is literally zero risk with the Infinite Vitality System.</p>
          <br>
          <p>You have a full 60-day, 100% money back guarantee. Meaning that, if at any point during the 60 days, you decide it’s not for you, you can ask for a full refund. No hassles, no hard feelings. You don’t even have to return the product.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Your satisfaction is 100% guaranteed!</p>

      <div class="common-question question-3">
        <div class="common-question-answer">
          <div class="common-question-question">
            <p>What about all that diet and exercise advice I’ve already learned and tried?</p>
          </div>
          <p>Well, right now, all that “learning” is part of what’s holding you back… until you first unlearn all the “fad advice” you’ve heard about creating lifelong energy and vitality. Then… the sky’s the limit!</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="common-question question-4">
        <div class="common-question-answer">
          <div class="common-question-question">
            <p>How soon can I expect results?</p>
          </div>
          <p>Well, everyone is different, and not everybody responds the same way to the Infinite Vitality System. </p>
          <br>
          <p>However, some people do experience powerful results the very next morning.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Others take some time. So we ask that you just follow the blueprint as directed, every day for at least 7 days, before you fully evaluate your results.</p>
