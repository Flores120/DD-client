            <p>I had already told my wife I was on the way home so we could finally have our long awaited “romantic date night” (which I planned with her as a hail-mary attempt at reviving our deteriorating marriage.)</p>
            <p>However, I just looked at the time, and realized I already put in yet another 12 hour work shift, and it was almost pitch black outside.</p>
            <p>And, just like the weather, I felt blue deep inside and you'll see why in a few minutes.</p>
            <p>You see...</p>

            <p>It was no big secret to anyone that I was already over-exhausted, anxious, and somewhat depressed - and that it simply wasn't going to get any better unless I took action (and I eventually did, just like you're about to today...)</p>

            <p>However, even though I knew I was ready for a change, I needed
            one more thing to really push me over the edge and get me to
            move from feeling sluggish and defeated, to energized and alive.</p>

            <p>Anyway, I can't believe I did this, but I got into my car and decided
            to drive home after my 12 hour shift - even though I was sleep
            deprived, moody, and in a mental haze...</p>

              <p>Turns out, I was so exhausted and "mentally unfit" to drive, and I was swerving all over the road like a mad man...</p>
              <p>And these cops thought that:</p>

            <p>They treated me like dirt and made false accusations, so naturally I snapped back with some attitude
            and became uncooperative.</p>

            <p>Now, this was a big deal because our relationship was already on the rocks. She accused me of being cold, distant, irritable, and always too tired to do anything.</p>
            <p>She said I never showed any romantic interest in her anymore, and yes... unfortunately this was completely true.</p>

            <p>It was more because I was feeling so drained from our arguments, from my demanding job, and from life in general, and I was simply feeling "burnt out" in every sense.</p>
            <p>Anyway, I used my "phone call" in the holding cell to call my wife, and tell her what happened.</p>
            <p>Naturally, she thought I was making the whole thing up, and it wouldn't have made a difference if I did anyway because the bottom line was that this was her breaking point.</p>
            <p>She was beyond upset, and told me she was packing up her stuff and leaving "for a few days."</p>
            <p>Let me tell you: as I sat in the holding cell, I felt miserable, alone, and like my entire world was collapsing around me.</p>
            <p>I felt like I had hit rock bottom... and that I had failed to live up to the expectations of everyone who loved me...</p>
            <p>I was beginning to feel completely depressed and borderline worthless, as if my life had not even been really lived, and I was just killing time between birth and death. (yes, it was getting THAT bad!)</p>
